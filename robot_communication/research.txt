Hi,

I am starting with bluepy and found that I cannot call the scanner without sudo.

$ python3 scanner.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "scanner.py", line 18, in <module>
    scanner.scan(10.0, passive=True)
  File "/home/spachner/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/bluepy/btle.py", line 734, in scan
    self.start(passive=passive)
  File "/home/spachner/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/bluepy/btle.py", line 672, in start
    self._mgmtCmd("le on")
  File "/home/spachner/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/bluepy/btle.py", line 283, in _mgmtCmd
    "Failed to execute mgmt cmd '%s'" % (cmd))
bluepy.btle.BTLEException: Failed to execute mgmt cmd 'le on'

Calling with sudo works fine:

$ sudo python3 scanner.py

How avoid using sudo?

Thanks in advance

The linux protocol stack needs additional capabilities. If you do not want to run your script as root (or under sudo), you may also give the required capabilities to the bluepy-helper binary, that comes with bluepy.
E.g.

sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip' bluepy-helper

On my Pi (currently Debian Stretch) the above command just gives a very unhelpful

  fatal error: Invalid argument

The following two commands do, however, fix it:

  sudo setcap cap_net_raw+e  <PATH>/bluepy-helper
  sudo setcap cap_net_admin+eip  <PATH>/bluepy-helper

Where <PATH> is the place where bluepy-helper is installed; it's easiest to just search for this, e.g.

  find /usr/local/lib -name bluepy-helper

Hi nescio007,

many thanks for the advice. Works perfect on Ubuntu 17.10. I found bluepy-helper being installed at /home/spachner/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/bluepy/bluepy-helper

regards

Why don't include the setcap call to the install tool?

I have the exact same issue on my Raspberry Pi Zero W with Raspbian Stretch lite (4.14). I tried all possible combinations of setcap (also looking into #190), without any success.

pi@zeropi01:/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/bluepy $ sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip' bluepy-helper
pi@zeropi01:/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/bluepy $ getcap bluepy-helper
bluepy-helper = cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw+eip

pi@zeropi01:~/projects/bluepy/bluepy $ python3 scanner.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "scanner.py", line 18, in <module>
    scanner.scan(10.0, passive=True)
  File "/home/pi/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/bluepy/btle.py", line 852, in scan
    self.start(passive=passive)
  File "/home/pi/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/bluepy/btle.py", line 790, in start
    self._mgmtCmd("le on")
  File "/home/pi/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/bluepy/btle.py", line 312, in _mgmtCmd
    raise BTLEManagementError("Failed to execute management command '%s'" % (cmd), rsp)
bluepy.btle.BTLEManagementError: Failed to execute management command 'le on' (code: 20, error: Permission Denied)

The strange thing is: after setting the capabilities, I was able to execute 'le on' manually without using sudo:

pi@zeropi01:/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/bluepy $ sudo setcap '' bluepy-helper
pi@zeropi01:/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/bluepy $ ./bluepy-helper 0
# bluepy-helper.c version 1.3.0 built at 12:54:59 on Dec  3 2018
le on
rsp=$mgmtcode=$mgmterrestat=h14emsg='Permission Denied
quit
pi@zeropi01:/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/bluepy $ sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip' bluepy-helper
pi@zeropi01:/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/bluepy $ ./bluepy-helper 0
# bluepy-helper.c version 1.3.0 built at 12:54:59 on Dec  3 2018
le on
rsp=$mgmtcode=$success
quit

Any ideas what might be going wrong here?

Thanks a lot!

Adding a note here since all other solutions suggestions failed in my case.

As per noble/noble#682 (comment)

The setcap command fails if your executable node is in an encrypted directory. I.e. if you chose to encrypt your home directory during install and bluepy-helper was located somewhere in home. Reported in that thread to be a bug in encryptfs. If you move the executable outside of the encrypted directory it is purported to work.

Feel free to follow up with a less-hacky solution if you happen upon one.

Did you find out how to fix this? I'm having exactly the same problem.

@alindl @mivola From the logs it seems that you have two bluepy installations:

    Your system-wide installation at /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/bluepy
    A user-local installation at ~/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/bluepy

It appears that you added the capabilities to the helper-binary of the system-wide installations, but then tried to use the local one, which has its own helper-binary that was not given additional capabilities.

TL;DR: when using pip install --user or virtualenv, make sure you set the capabilities on the correct helper-binary ;)

I should ask more questions, because I JUST figured it out myself as your message was plopping up here. That's the second time that happened this week sweat_smile So yeah, that was the problem and it's working now.

    @alindl @mivola From the logs it seems that you have two bluepy installations:

I also had 2 installations, because it seemed that the command-line would use Python-2, whereas Thonny used Python-3:

/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/bluepy/bluepy-helper
/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/bluepy/bluepy-helper

so the

sudo setcap cap_net_raw+e      <PATH>/bluepy-helper
sudo setcap cap_net_admin+eip  <PATH>/bluepy-helper

commands had to be repeated for each installation
